WWW::Mechanize is a fork of Kirrily Robert's excellent WWW::Automate
module.  W::A works fine except for some memory-eating bugs that I've
fixed.

I hope that by releasing a forked module that others who rely on W::A
can help continue development.  I've submitted patches to Kirrily, but
unfortunately her circumstances are such that W::A is low on the priority
list.  I hope that somewhere down the line that we can reincorporate
the changes made here with WWW::Mechanize back into WWW::Automate.

Sample:

    use WWW::Mechanize;
    my $agent = WWW::Mechanize->new();

    $agent->get($url);

    $agent->follow($link);

    $agent->form($number);
    $agent->field($name, $value);
    $agent->click($button);

    $agent->back();

    $agent->add_header($name => $value);

    use Test::More;
    like( $agent->{content}, /$expected/, "Got expected content" );

Revision history for Perl extension WWW::Mechanize

0.41	May 22, 2003	
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* There are no enhancements in functionality.
	* Testing suite getting more network-independent.

	[DOCUMENTATION]
	* Started a FAQ section.
	* New SYNOPSIS section.  Thanks to Uri Guttmann.
	* Documentation fixes.  Thanks to Mark Stosberg, Mike Fragassi.

0.40	April 18, 2003
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* Three new methods.
	  * find_link() for finding a specified link
	  * follow_link() for following a specified link
	  * submit_form() for all-in-one form submission.
	  All three owe a great deal to Uri Guttmann.  Thanks, Uri!
	* Split out the examples into WWW::Mechanize::Examples.pod
	* Added t/back.t
	* Documentation fixes from Abigail

0.39	April 1, 2003
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* No functional enhancements.  Everything is docs.
	
	* Added a new example from Dan Rinzel, for posting to Movable Type

	* Started playing with having the test suite not have to have
	  live net access.

0.38	March 24, 2003	
	[DEPRECATIONS]
	* The %WWW::Mechanize::Headers hash is officially deprecated.
	  It will be removed pretty soon.  I'm not sure what the
	  replacement will be, but it won't be a package-level hash.

	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* The submit() method is no longer an alias for click("submit"),
	  because some forms don't have a button called "submit".
	  In fact, some may not have any buttons at all if they're
	  JavaScript-controlled.
	  
	[FIXES]
	* RT #2056: $agent->field() wasn't returning proper input field,
	  because of an incorrect call to the underlying HTML::Form.
	  Thanks to Prakash Kailasa.

0.37	March 4, 2003
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* Added an is_html() method
	* Added a title() method
	* No longer requires the Clone module.
	* No longer requires the Test::Pod module, although it's nice
	  to have.

0.36	February 4, 2003
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* Added form lookup by name.  Thanks to Jan Ivar Pladsen and
	  Iain Truskett for their patches.
	* Added new functions form_name() and form_number().  Existing
	  form() function calls each of these as appropriate.
	* Explicitly requires LWP 5.69 because of the form naming.
	* Added new POD section "Examples" for user-submitted sample code
	  of how to use WWW::Mechanize.
	* Quieted the warnings in the test suite, so that you don't get
	  expected, but disconcerting, warnings to the screen.

0.35	January 22, 2003
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* Now creates an internal cookie_jar by default.
	* Beefing up the test suite
	* Don't forget, direct access to internal members is deprecated.
	  Use the accessors starting now.

0.33	January 15, 2003
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* Added accessor methods
	* Deprecated the direct accessing of object contents.  You can
	  no longer rely on the names of any of the hash elements.
	* Added a quiet() method to suppress warnings to the screen.

	[FIXES]
	* More documentation fixes.  (Thanks to Briac Pilpré)

0.32	September 23, 2002
	[FIXES]
	* Now correctly calls the LWP::UserAgent constructor.  (Thanks to
	  Philippe "BooK" Bruhat)

	* Fixed doc on what get() method returns.  (Again thanks to BooK)

	* Now uses http://www.google.com/intl/en/ as the basis for
	  testing, since non-US users apparently get redirected to
	  country-specific sites when they hit http://www.google.com/

0.31	September 13, 2002
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* get() now returns the HTTP::Response object.
	* Prepended push_page_stack(), pop_page_stack() and
	  do_request() with underscores, to emphasize that they 
	  are for internal use only.

0.30	September 10, 2002
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* Fixed the stack popping problem.
	
	[FIXES]
	* Put all the inline tests into t/*.t
	
	* get() doesn't work w/relative URLs
	http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=1492

	* The arrays returned by extract_links()
	now have a third element, which contains
	the name attribute of the link (undef
	if the link has no name attribute).


Code before this point is forked off from WWW::Automate 0.20b.

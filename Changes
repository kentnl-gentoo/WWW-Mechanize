Revision history for Perl extension WWW::Mechanize

0.36	February 4, 2003
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* Added form lookup by name.  Thanks to Jan Ivar Pladsen and
	  Iain Truskett for their patches.
	* Added new functions form_name() and form_number().  Existing
	  form() function calls each of these as appropriate.
	* Explicitly requires LWP 5.69 because of the form naming.
	* Added new POD section "Examples" for user-submitted sample code
	  of how to use WWW::Mechanize.
	* Quieted the warnings in the test suite, so that you don't get
	  expected, but disconcerting, warnings to the screen.

0.35	January 22, 2003
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* Now creates an internal cookie_jar by default.
	* Beefing up the test suite
	* Don't forget, direct access to internal members is deprecated.
	  Use the accessors starting now.

0.33	January 15, 2003
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* Added accessor methods
	* Deprecated the direct accessing of object contents.  You can
	  no longer rely on the names of any of the hash elements.
	* Added a quiet() method to suppress warnings to the screen.

	[FIXES]
	* More documentation fixes.  (Thanks to Briac Pilpré)

0.32	September 23, 2002
	[FIXES]
	* Now correctly calls the LWP::UserAgent constructor.  (Thanks to
	  Philippe "BooK" Bruhat)

	* Fixed doc on what get() method returns.  (Again thanks to BooK)

	* Now uses http://www.google.com/intl/en/ as the basis for
	  testing, since non-US users apparently get redirected to
	  country-specific sites when they hit http://www.google.com/

0.31	September 13, 2002
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* get() now returns the HTTP::Response object.
	* Prepended push_page_stack(), pop_page_stack() and
	  do_request() with underscores, to emphasize that they 
	  are for internal use only.

0.30	September 10, 2002
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* Fixed the stack popping problem.
	
	[FIXES]
	* Put all the inline tests into t/*.t
	
	* get() doesn't work w/relative URLs
	http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=1492

	* The arrays returned by extract_links()
	now have a third element, which contains
	the name attribute of the link (undef
	if the link has no name attribute).


Code before this point is forked off from WWW::Automate 0.20b.

Revision history for Perl extension WWW::Mechanize

0.31	September 13, 2002
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* get() now returns the HTTP::Response object.
	* Prepended push_page_stack(), pop_page_stack() and
	  do_request() with underscores, to emphasize that they 
	  are for internal use only.

0.30	September 10, 2002
	[ENHANCEMENTS]
	* Fixed the stack popping problem.
	
	[FIXES]
	* Put all the inline tests into t/*.t
	
	* get() doesn't work w/relative URLs
	http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=1492

	* The arrays returned by extract_links()
	now have a third element, which contains
	the name attribute of the link (undef
	if the link has no name attribute).


Code before this point is forked off from WWW::Automate 0.20b.
